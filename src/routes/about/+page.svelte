        Answer as many questions as possible. Each correct answer has a corresponding prize. If you answer incorrectly, you lose the game. Once you reach the safe haven prizes (prizes that are marked with diamonds), you are guaranteed to get those amount even if you answer incorrectly. You can quit anytime within the game.
